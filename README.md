****
The links that are set to 1 are crawlled through this prog. It collects about 14K unique word after 
going through about 10 links. Since there is no limitation to the amount of word collected, as it is ment
for this purpose solely, this crawlls through the whole internet. I have collected about 3K word in this repo,
make sure to cross the terminal since Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D doesn't works here too. It collected Russian, Chinese, Bengali, Japnese ,Vietnamese with english words. Enjoy!!!
